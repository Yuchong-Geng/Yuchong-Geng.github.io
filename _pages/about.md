Hi, my name is Yuchong Geng. I am a second year MEng student at Cornell University. My current research focuses on edge computing with topics ranging from edge datacenters to edge Machine Learning for robotics. I am fortunate to be advised by and work with [Prof. A. Kevin Tang](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/kevin-tang) and [Prof. Sandeep Chinchali](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/sandeep-chinchali). Previsouly, I received a BS degree in Electrical Engineering from University of California, Davis, where I was fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Omeed Momeni](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/momeni/).

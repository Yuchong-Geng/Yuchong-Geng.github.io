Hi, my name is Yuchong Geng. I am a first-year PhD student at Cornell University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. A. Kevin Tang](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/kevin-tang) at Cornell.

Previsouly, I received an <strong>MEng in ECE</strong> from Cornell University and a <strong>BS in Electrical Engineering</strong> from University of California, Davis. 

Research Interests

My research interests lie in Computer System, Artificial Intelligence, and the intersection between those two. One example is an intelligent data sharing framework for fleet robots.

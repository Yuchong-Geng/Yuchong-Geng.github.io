Hi, my name is Yuchong Geng. I am a first-year PhD student at Cornell University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. A. Kevin Tang](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/kevin-tang) at Cornell.

Previsouly, I received an <strong>MEng in ECE</strong> from Cornell University and a <strong>BS in Electrical Engineering</strong> from University of California, Davis. 

Research Interests
======

My research interests lie in Computer System, Artificial Intelligence, and the intersection between those two. One example is an intelligent data sharing framework for fleet robots.

News
======

- **07/2022:** I will continue my education at Cornell as a PhD student in School of ECE.
- **11/2021:** I gave a talk at [CoRL 2021](https://www.robot-learning.org/) hosted in London, UK.
- **10/2021:** A paper about my research work during my MEng study at Cornell has been accepted to [CoRL 2021](https://www.robot-learning.org/).

## Overview

This project explores the use of Machine Learning for motor imagery tasks classification. Specifically, motor imagery tasks refer to human's mental simulation of an actual task such as lifting right hand, and the EEG signals of expreiment human subjects are recorded for analysis. This project is chanllenging because of the large amount of noise that is present in EEG signals.

## Overview

The autonomous vehicle is a senior design project from UC Davis ECE department. The goal of this project is to design, develop and build a fully-autonomous and high-performance race car from scratch. The race car uses a high-speed camera to detect race tracks marked by 1"-wide white tape and an on-board processor uses the camera feed to control the speed and direction of the race car. The race car is evaluated by the its best lap time minus penelties such as hitting a traffic cone. This project follows the same rules from [NATCAR competition](https://ece.ucdavis.edu/natcar) which is hosted by UC Davis and UC Berkeley. Our race car can achieve a speed of 5.07 ft/s in a race track containing features such as lane crossings and sharp turns wihout hitting any traffic cones. It has the ability to operate at a higher speed with precision tradeoff.

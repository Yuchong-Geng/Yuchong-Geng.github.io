## Overview

Featuring the concept of TCP bandwidth probing strategy, RPM is a resource management system that exponentially increases CPU power when violation of QoS is detected to quickly allocate enough resource to satisfy desired QoS and linearly decrease CPU power when waste of CPU power is detected to increase system efficiency in an extremely prudent manner.
